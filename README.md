This project uses lazy sequences to develop a list of 30 base ten birthdays based off an inputed birthday from a user. It also uses clojure tests to ensure all the dates are being calculated correctly. Additionally, can be used to find a desired amount of days after one day or a specific date a given amount of days away from
a specified date.
